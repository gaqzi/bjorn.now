I bought a HP netbook this week with the explicit intent to use [GNU/Linux][linux] on it. I wagered that someone had gotten the built-in 3G modem working and while it was a pain to get installed I was right, someone had made it work!

To help anyone who would be in the same position as I was a couple of days ago I've written down the steps I followed to get my modem working on my own [wiki] and also packed all the files I need to get this working up as a download.

So for the meat of this post please see the [HP un2400 3G modem in Linux][modem-wiki] page on the wiki.
