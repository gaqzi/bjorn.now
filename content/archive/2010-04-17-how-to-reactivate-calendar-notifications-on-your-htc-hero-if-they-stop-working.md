A couple of months back, out of the blue, my [HTC Hero] stopped notifying me on my upcoming calendar events. It didn't even show upcoming events on the home screen widget, but it kept syncing new events without a problem. 

I tried adding and re-adding the calendars I sync on the phone, turning on/off the notifications but nothing worked. I found a link to a guy who had the same problem, which ended up being caused by him force quitting the alarm service. But I had not done that, and either way it should've started working after a reboot if that were the case. Another guy managed to get his notifications working after doing a factory defaults reset.

Resetting to factory defaults isn't my first choice of action, so I searched for, [and found][link-to-source], a way to reset the calendar instead. And after doing that a test notification I set to go off a couple of minutes earlier got synced back to the phone and went off!

On your phone:

> Settings -> Applications -> Manage applications  
> Open up `Calendar storage` and press `Clear data`.  
> I also cleared the `Calendar` app, not sure if it was needed though. 

Posting in hope that if anyone else have this problem they won't have to rummage through the internet as I did.
