I've been having trouble at work with the available bandwidth running out when I and my co-workers are using [Spotify], a very nice piece of software, [but just like Skype][skype-bw] it tries to split its content through all available nodes and make sure they share it, which includes its users.

So what I did to force Spotify to only connect and fetch data from the Spotify servers was to use the built-in firewall in Windows XP and specify that `spotify.exe` is only allowed to connect to: [`78.31.8.0/22,193.182.8.0/21`][spotify-servers], mix up some traffic priority rules at the router for connections to those IP:s and Spotify can still be used, and not taking up all available bandwidth.

**Updated 2011-08-23**: Added a new IP-range that Spotify uses, 193.182.8.0/21.
