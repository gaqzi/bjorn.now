I have been back in Sweden for almost a month, and about 2.5 weeks in a furnished rental apartment in [Karlstad, Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlstad), after 13 years in Singapore. 

Currently listening to Ghost's [The Future is a Foreign Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz24W6CQ0HI) on repeat while trying to build up a routine for my new gentleman (heh) of leisure persona. And on routine building, I haven't gotten much done during my first week without a job, it has been nice to take it easy. I tried going through the first steps of starting my company today, but I'm [haunting the Swedish paperwork machine]({{< ref "/crumb/2025-09-23-21st-century-digital-society.md" >}}), present but not quite real. I'll wait it out and see if I materialize.

Starting to adjust to the apartment, and the balcony has [become my home office]({{< ref "/scrap/2025-09-14T105315.md" >}}), and I have borrowed a portal heater from my brother Hasse, so I have 1900w of heating helping keep the balcony warm as the evenings and mornings get colder (around 14Â°C when I get up). Curious to learn what the electrical bill will be ðŸ˜› One of the interesting thoughts from the recent while is how much advice is about all the things I need, and "[maybe, let's see in a couple of weeks]({{< ref "/crumb/2025-09-26-maybe-lets-see-in-a-few-weeks.md" >}})," has been my goto response so far.

Got a chance to hang out with the nieces and nephew last weekend to do an early birthday celebration for the oldest niece, hanging out with family and playing with the kids. And this weekend I'll be house sitting for my mom, or well, I'll be driving them to the train to go to Gothenburg and then I can be wherever as long as I'm picking them up on Sunday. So why not stay in their house and eat their food? ðŸ˜œ

I have a trip to Nuremberg in October to attend a baptism, and tickets to [Electric Callboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDnIEWyVIlE) in Stockholm in November, and I [discovered]({{< ref "/scrap/2025-09-23T202248.md" >}}) that [The Northern Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VXKhJfRQ7k) are playing in London in December, so that's also scheduled now. I'm starting to have a schedule. I think next will be to consider going to [FOSDEM at the end of January](https://fosdem.org/2026/) since I haven't been before and it seems fun and relevant to my interests. I'll consider [CCC](https://events.ccc.de/en/2025/) some other year.

## Moving home and starting a company

I decided towards the end of 2024 that I wanted to:

1. work less (so I have left my employer of five years (tied for longest I've had), and I have very ambivalent feelings about it, friends have told me it's career suicide (it is, but is it what I want?) and others say it's a sign of maturity to take a break. At the same time I really want time off. I took a 3mon unpaid sabbatical last year because I needed it, and I didn't manage to change my ways of working enough to not feel tired again after a couple of months)
2. start my own company (which is what I hear you do if you _really_ want to work less, I guess more, work on what _I_ want)
3. get closer to family. 

I was considering other places in Europe for a while (Berlin, Tallinn), because I liked the idea of continuing to be an expat (am I even Swedish anymore?), but after thinking it through I realized that making friends in a new place is hard and can't get closer to family than within an hour's car ride, and if you don't stay in one of the big cities, then Sweden can be cheap and make my runway longer.

I wonder whether I'll acclimate back to life in Sweden after living for so long in Singapore (which is a world city), even if people there often feel it's too safe and boring. I have already planned for going to one of the bigger cities nearby (by train, ideally) once a month for tech meetups or similar, so that I don't get too insular.

Right now all my stuff is in a warehouse in Singapore waiting to be packaged into a container as soon as there's enough _other cargo_ going to Sweden. I have no idea when my stuff will show up, and I was originally, optimistically, hoping I'd have most of it by mid-October or so. It'll be fun to see how long that takes ðŸ˜…

## Taking more control of my online life

I have been a bit enamored by the [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) model of owning what you publish and do, and because my plan is to work in the open (post devlogs, share how I'm exploring, and learning, the [series]({{< ref "/series/" >}}) are examples of how) as I start my own company, I want to be in control of the stuff I write and that's why I started updating this site. I've never been good at posting, and I tend to go verbose when I do, so writing longer and then posting/linking on other platforms feels more like what I should do. And then we'll see if others find it useful or not. I have had some mild success on LinkedIn, and I'm not sure if I should be happy that it's the crowd that likes what I'm writing or not. Makes me slightly doubt that I'm breaking out to run a small thing ðŸ˜œ

I'm trying to figure out how I want to do it all, [Posse Party](https://posseparty.com) seems really neat, and Searls is getting it out in the next couple of months. I don't like the idea of cross-posting manually until then, or completely building something from scratch. There are various feed2toot and similar tools available to wire up myself, but urgh. We'll see. I like the idea of a tool and the description from the party website is what I'd like and it feels silly to rebuild it.

For now, I have spun up an instance of [n8n](https://n8n.io), originally to just capture form submissions, and then discovered how simple it was to setup a workflow that cross-posts to Telegram, Mastodon, and Bluesky for me. It hasn't been very thoroughly done, but it works good enough for now. Maybe it'll be good enough by the time the party is ready, we'll see. I'm realizing I want to change the format for how I post to make things work better, but I'll need to explore my needs more before I make any decisions.

## Learning and self-improvement

The thing I want to work on for my company is tools to help people be more intentional when they work, and to learn the skills to "see more," which for me has been about various forms of journaling.

I did a presentation in October 2024 at work (I'll share it once I start working, it's basically my blueprint, though totally unvalidated) and several people tried to do it, but many of them fell off using many of my techniques, which I honestly only follow on good days (which isn't all of them), so how can I lower the barrier and make it easier? I think a part of this pitch is learning the skills that the current generation of AI tools can't do, unique ideas, and creating novel connections, which comes from engaging with your surroundings.

So to figure that out I'm trying to figure out experiments to run and then learning more about learning itself, so I can try and do something.

One of the things I need to do in the next couple of weeks is figure out a rough sales pitch and setup a signup page, I hoped to have this out when I had my last day but I ended up sending people to follow this site instead. I'll extend it a bit and also explain what I'm hoping to try out for the alpha so it's clearer than just "trust me, the effort will be worth it."
