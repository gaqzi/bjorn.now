Curtis shared the [DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid), that I hadn't heard of, and said that he feels that the genies helps him process the first two layers much more quickly than he can alone, that it can somewhat help penetrate into knowledge but not much.
Which allows him to spend less time in D/I (collection) and then more to then K/W (processing?)

This is true, I have felt that if I provide enough information when trying to find something I can get out reams of useful and contextual D/I, but the biggest problem is attribution: I don't know if it's real or hallucinations, and you need to make sure you get the references so you can confirm it. BUT, I am spending less time _reading wide_ because it can help narrow it. (which sounds like the ideal librarian who can help you find _just that book you need_ based on what you explained).
