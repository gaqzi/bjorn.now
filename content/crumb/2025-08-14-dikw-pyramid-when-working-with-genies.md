title: 'DIKW pyramid when working with genies'

Curtis shared the [DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid), that I hadn't heard of, and said that he feels that the genies helps him process the first two layers much more quickly than he can alone, that it can somewhat help penetrate into knowledge but not much.
Which allows him to spend less time in D/I (collection) and then more to then K/W (processing?)

<!-- add the pyramid image -->

This is true, I have felt that if I provide enough information when trying to find something I can get out reams of useful and contextual D/I, but the biggest problem is attribution: I don't know if it's real or hallucinations, and you need to make sure you get the references so you can confirm it. BUT, I am spending less time _reading wide_ because it can help narrow it. (which sounds like the ideal librarian who can help you find _just that book you need_ based on what you explained). 

<!-- continued from reading the DIKW article and sharing with Curtis

reading the DIKW page and was curious about the definitions, my gut for what data/information is was correct, but I see it seems to get vaguer with knowledge.

> Zeleny has asserted that to capture knowledge in symbolic form is to make it into information, i.e., that "All knowledge is tacit".

this feels correct somehow. But also this:

> Knowledge is a fluid mix of framed experience, values, contextual information, expert insight and grounded intuition that provides an environment and framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and information. It originates and is applied in the minds of knowers. In organizations it often becomes embedded not only in documents and repositories but also in organizational routines, processes, practices and norms.

It feels like _knowledge_ is personal. Also why I like the idea of knowledge "made specific" becomes information, and then needs to be contextualized into someones situation as knowledge -> and then that combination can then be "made specific" again into information that others can use in that context.

no idea if that makes sense :slightly_smiling_face:

Wisdom even fluffier, but I kinda wonder if that's moving from tacit -> explicit, but the difference from `information` is that it's not only contextual to _one concrete_ situation, it's when you can teach/identify the meta "skill" of whatever you have knowledge?

Then again, I also like the simple version of "knowledge is that a tomato is a fruit. wisdom is to not put it in a fruit salad."

> Zeleny described wisdom as "know-why", but later refined his definitions, so as to differentiate "why do" (wisdom) from "why is" (information), and expanding his definition to include a form of know-what ("what to do, act or carry out"). And, as noted by Nikhil Sharma, Zeleny has argued for a tier to the model beyond wisdom, termed "enlightenment".

trying to put an example to DIKW just to conceptualize it for myself:

* Data: today
    * Bought 1 coffe x $5.5
    * Got 1 machine coffee in office x $0
* Information: I usually buy two coffees for a total of $10
* Knowledge: I'm trying to spend less so halving the cost helps me get there, while also giving me one some good coffee per day
* Wisdom: If I make a thermos of good coffee at home and bring to the office I'll get two good cups and it's cheaper

And to be fair, after I read the Wikipedia article and then asked Geminie to describe the DIKW pyramid based on the above messages. Then I used the coffee example to validate that I got it (but also taking that there's no commona greed definition of wisdom)
