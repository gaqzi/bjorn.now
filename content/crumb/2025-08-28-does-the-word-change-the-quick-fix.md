I'm in Bengaluru to attend a friend's wedding, and it has been _fascinating_ walking around and seeing "the creative ways" of cable management, and my perspective from Singapore and Sweden is definitely to question the safety and longevity.

{{< figure src="/img/2025/bengaluru-electrical-cables.jpg" caption="Coils of cables, some without the protective coating, all just lying around. What looks like some fiber cables for good measure." >}}

In the group chat for the wedding the groom said that a very helpful word to explain this is "[jugaad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad)" which per Wikipedia:

> a concept of non-conventional, frugal innovation on the Indian subcontinent. It also includes innovative fixes or simple workarounds, solutions that bend the rules, or resources that can be used in such a way.

Fair enough, make do with what you have, I love that, but I still feltâ€¦ uncomfortable even if I can appreciate that it works. (as an aside, it's worth reading the whole Wikipedia article for the examples!)

I showed some of these photos to Mari who then pointed out that this is the **physical manifestation of 'getting it done at any cost'** we've seen in some projects at work. Which made me realize where some of my discomfort was coming from.

While reading the Wikipedia page I saw the related article for "[kludge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge)" which is defined as:

> a workaround or makeshift solution that is clumsy, inelegant, inefficient, difficult to extend, and hard to maintain. **Its only benefit is that it rapidly solves an important problem using available resources.**

Something clicked: for work, that's the definition I want to use (because the company is [in extract](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/fast-slow-in-3x-explore-expand-extract-6d4c94a7539) so making it well is what we need most of the time). Then, reading on, I saw in the section of [use in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge#Computer_science), that hack is often used interchangeably with kludge, but that:

> Hack can also be used with a positive connotation, for a quick solution to a frustrating problem.

I have definitely used hack both ways. Beautiful for creative solutions. Horrible when I worry about the insurance premium. And "a hack that works isn't a hack." Which I always read a bit as 'an unusual solution that works is good,' but, that means you're muddying the waters. One person's hack is another person's hack. ðŸ¤¦

And it makes me wonder how much connotation we're putting in the words, because some of these absolutely atrocious kludges we've put in at work to hit a deadline were necessary, and some weren't. The deadline was a sadline and we could've taken the time to do it correctly. But if you have internalized a version where delivering at any cost is the highest value, even if it future work will be harderâ€¦ then that's the tradeoff we're making.

I wonder if it would make a difference to stop using the word "hack," which has both a positive and negative connotation, and instead used "kludge" (or bodge for the brits) and were clear that the only redeeming quality was getting something out the door, and _now_, **right now**, we have to figure out how to make it maintainable. Before we move on and create the next kludge.
