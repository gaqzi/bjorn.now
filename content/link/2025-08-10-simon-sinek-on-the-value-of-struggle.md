[Simon Sinek on AI and the value of struggle](https://podscripts.co/podcasts/the-diary-of-a-ceo-with-steven-bartlett/simon-sinek-youre-being-lied-to-about-ais-real-purpose-and-were-teaching-our-kids-to-not-be-human), via Arjit:

> People keep telling us life is not about the destination. Life is about the journey. But when we think about AI, we only think about the destination. And it's remarkable ability to write the book, paint the painting, solve the problem, but we forget the importance of doing the work yourself.

> And I think **in our modern day and age, we have underrepresented the value of struggle.  I am smarter, better at problem solving, more resourceful, not because a book exists with my ideas in it, but because I wrote it. That excruciating journey is what made me grow.**

> But it's the same for love, friendships, conflict. And I think that we forget that we give up certain skills or abilities because of technology.

The struggle is the point. More people can generate a mediocre painting or write perfect English now, but they won't understand the beauty behind either without doing the work. And it's our prerogative to decide which struggles matter to us or if we just wanted something nice to hang in the toilet.
