Justin Searls asks [which of your colleagues are screwed?](https://justin.searls.co/posts/which-of-your-colleagues-are-screwed/)

> I've been writing about how AI is likely to affect white-collar (or no-collar or hoodie-wearing) computer programmers […] 
> Think about a random colleague you don't feel particularly strongly about as you read the following pithy and reductive bullet points. […]
> They're going to be screwed if they exhibit:

> - Curiosity without skepticism
> - Strategy without experiments
> - Ability without understanding
> - Productivity without urgency
> - Creativity without taste
> - Certainty without evidence

I recently said that I think [curiosity is what makes a good software engineer]({{< relref "blog/2025-08-21-what-makes-a-good-software-engineer.md" >}}), and gave examples of when/how they should be curious, but never pointed out that it has to come with a balancing function.

I can't think of anything done 100% full-throttle that isn't detrimental without something to balance it, but it's tacit and not something I often think about immediately. For example, if you live your life 100% in service it will be limiting, a bit of selfishness is required, see [Doug Forcett from The Good Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPEwD7WpI9g).
