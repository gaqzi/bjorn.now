I shared my [swedish pizza]({{< relref "2025-09-03T132628.md" >}}) lunch, and while I know people have strong feelings about pineapple on pizza, I'm genuinely surprised at how strong the reaction is to the creative use of ingredients we have for pizza in Sweden. Swedish pizza is some of the best around and that's a hill I'll die on!

(one person asked "is this throw-up on pizza?" ðŸ˜…)
