I shared my [swedish pizza]({{< relref "2025-09-03T132628.md" >}}) lunch, and while I know people have strong feelings about pineapple on pizza, I'm genuinely surprised at how strong the reaction is to [the creative use of ingredients](https://patiolist.com/what-is-a-swedish-pizza-uncovering-a-unique-culinary-fusion) we have for pizza. Swedish pizza is some of the best around and that's a hill I'll die on!

(one person asked "is this throw-up on pizza?" ðŸ˜…)
