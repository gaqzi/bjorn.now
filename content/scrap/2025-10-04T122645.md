Being back and speaking Swedish every day, and more than in years, I have felt that my Swedish has atrophied a bit. That I'm not able to express myself as well in it as in English, so I decided to read a bit more in Swedish.

{{< figure src="/img/2025/10-first-swedish-books.jpeg" caption="[August Strindberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Strindberg)'s [Dödsdansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dance_of_Death_(Strindberg_play)) & [Spöksonaten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_Sonata) and [Fredrik Backman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrik_Backman)'s [Björnstad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beartown_(novel))" alt="Two books resting on a black cushion: a cream-colored vintage edition of August Strindberg plays and a Fredrik Backman novel with a blue winter scene cover showing a hockey player, with a potted plant visible in the background">}}

I ended up getting a very contemporary author and one very much not. I read Backman's blog back before he got his first book published, so I knew how funny he was and I read half of Beartown yesterday, he's really nailing the storytelling. I had a hard time putting the book down.

Strindberg is famous and I haven't ever read or seen anything by him (that I know of), so why not. I suspect it'll be a harder read in many ways. It was a very random pick, because I just strolled around the library (second library card down, now I can use Libby from my Kobo), and I totally picked it because Ghost has a song called [Spöksonat](https://genius.com/Ghost-spoksonat-lyrics), so why not…
