I told Peter that I'm going to have to install a new VPS because my existing one has been humming along since 2015 and is wildly out of date, and so are my Ansible roles. He suggested I do it with [NixOS](http://nixos.org/) because then I don't need Ansible and this other tooling. Starting to read about Nix again it got me thinking of the Monty Python philosophers: "Is your name not Nix then? No, it's Michael. That's gonna cause a little confusion. Mind if we call you Nix, just to keep it clear?"
