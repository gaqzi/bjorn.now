and now the [bank has confirmed]({{< relref "2025-10-23T104336.md" >}}) that I've sent the money, and sent it on to Bolagsverket.

I love the transparency and setup of [their page](https://bolagsverket.se/omoss/varverksamhet/varservice/varahandlaggningstider.2081.html) explaining how long it should take to process my application, there's a goal (7 working days), and which applications they're aiming to process this week (those from 14-19th of October). Wish more gov't services did this. *eyes Försäkringskassan*
