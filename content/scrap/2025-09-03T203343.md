drove a car for the first time in a looong while today (years), and after I backed out of the driveway something felt off: I wasn't 100% sure _where_ I was supposed to be on the road. 

I just came to Sweden yesterday, after five days in Bengaluru, India, where I sat in the front passenger seat (i.e. the Swedish driver's seat). I was positioning the car like I had been sitting in India (fast thinking?).

So I decided to go back to the driveway, because I'm not putting someone else at risk when I haven't driven for a while and I'm getting a weird feeling.

As I went back I reflected that I **know** it's right-hand drive in Sweden (slow thinking?), but I had mostly experienced sitting in that seat as a passenger in left-hand driving countries (Singapore for more than a decade, and just days before, India). I was 95% sure it meant I put myself so I'm closer to the middle of the road.

As I looked it up online: yes, I'm supposed to be towards the middle of the road when driving. I didn't hit anything. And the sense of the car started coming back after a couple of kilometers. Just like riding a bike ðŸ˜‰
