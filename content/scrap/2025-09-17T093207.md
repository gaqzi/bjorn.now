and after realizing for the umpteenth time how annoying it is to spell out this domain name, which I do love, I decided to register [bjorn.now](http://bjorn.now) to point people to my /now page and this domain. The vanity domain amuses me, and it's practical ðŸ™‚ 

Now, what email should I setup for that domain? me@? ba@?
