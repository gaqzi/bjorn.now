{{< figure src="/img/2025/09-coffee-with-rhubarb-pie.jpeg" caption="A rhubarb pie with whipped cream and a cup of coffee" >}}

today I found a shop that has specialty coffee [Krukmakeri Hemjord](https://visitvarmland.com/kristinehamn/design-shopping/hantverk/krukmakeri-hemjord/) (amongst other things) in Kristinehamn, and the owner has the same name as I do and is a proper coffee nerd. 

He's been telling me about the coffees as I was planning to sit here a couple of hours, and we ended up with Ethiopian coffees, and I am now trying an anaerobic Ethiopian. While I have tried this in the past I haven't known what to expect of it properly, and now that I know the citrusy/acidic _is_ the point of this it's quite nice as I like sour/acidic. Before this cup I had a similar but washed, and it was very tame in comparison. Very nice, and coincidentally they're even brewing with the Clever Dripper (which I got recently), so I have some practical ideas for how to repeat at home.
