Hasse and I went for a walk into Karlstad city center yesterday and spotted this vending machine right by [Klaraälven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klarälven) and near the opera.

{{< figure src="/img/2025/09-kayakomat.jpeg" caption="Kayakomat, the kayak vending" alt="A green wooden shed labeled 'KAYAKOMAT' with numbered red, yellow, and green kayaks stored horizontally on racks, functioning as a self-service kayak rental station" >}}
