the joy of dealing with things international: DHL refuses to send my work laptop to Singapore using the standard mobile site because it's too valuable, it might work on some other site that doesn't work on mobile. Schenker happily takes it but will deliver it when they want to, but only in Europe. Postnord can't validate the postal code in Singapore (bug report sent) so I can't send. Once more into the breach trying to suss out the other site DHL got. ðŸ¤¬
