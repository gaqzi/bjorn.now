## RSS feeds

For the feed reader crowd:

**Not sure which feed to choose?** Start with [Everything](/feed.xml) or [Blog only](/blog/feed.xml).

- [Everything](/feed.xml): The full firehose, everything I post goes in here
- [TIL](/til/feed.xml): Things I learned and want to remember
- [Scraps](/scrap/feed.xml): Scraps, the tweets or toots, but here. Shorter things.
- [Crumbs](/crumb/feed.xml): Breadcrumbs. Half-finished thoughts, notes to future me, questions I'm mulling over. These might grow into something bigger or just stay as markers along the way.
- [Links](/link/feed.xml): Links I want to remember or think others might find useful. I will share what I find interesting with the link and why you might want to read it.
- [Blog](/blog/feed.xml): The longer pieces where I've worked through something more completely. Still thinking out loud, just… more of it.

Individual series and tags have their own feeds, find them on their respective pages.
