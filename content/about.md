I think there are [some](https://justin.searls.co) [great](https://simonwillison.net) [blogs](https://ronjeffries.com) out there where people just share what they're working on, thinking about, and what they've discovered. I have written many half-finished drafts and notes on many topics over the years, but I never got around to publishing. After about two decades of mucking around with software and technical leadership as both a happy hobbyist and *hardcore professional*, I want to change that and do more thinking and sharing in the open. Partly because I want to share more, partly because I've been told how much seeing how I work through problems has helped people, and partly because I'm planning to build a product and hope to benefit from y'alls feedback and suggestions by doing more of the work in the open.
