I think there are [some](https://justin.searls.co) [great](https://simonwillison.net) [blogs](https://ronjeffries.com) out there where people just share what they're working on, thinking about, and what they've discovered. I have written many half-finished drafts and notes on many topics over the years, but I never got around to publishing. After about two decades of mucking around with software and technical leadership as both a happy hobbyist and *hardcore professional*, I want to change that and do more thinking and sharing in the open. Partly because I want to share more, partly because I've been told how much seeing how I work through problems has helped people, and partly because I'm planning to build a product and hope to benefit from y'alls feedback and suggestions by doing more of the work in the open.

## How I'm organizing things here

I've been thinking about different ways to share what I'm learning. Not everything needs to be a full blog post, so I'm experimenting with different formats:

**[TIL](/til/):** Things I learned (not necessarily today) that I want to remember and might help others. Quick discoveries from debugging sessions, neat tricks, useful commands.

**[crumb](/crumb/):** Breadcrumbs. Half-finished thoughts, notes to future me, questions I'm mulling over. These might grow into something bigger or just stay as markers along the way.

**[scrap](/scrap/):** Tiny thoughts, moments, or random things that pop to mind. The tweets or toots but here. Hot takes, brain farts, shower thoughts, you know, whatever.

**[link](/link/):** Things I found useful and want to find again. I'll try to add context about why I'm saving it.

<!--
**[presentation](/presentation/):** Talks I've given that I want to keep track of. Slides and video when available.
-->
**[blog](/blog/):** The longer pieces where I've worked through something more completely. Still thinking out loud, justâ€¦ more of it.

This structure helps me share more frequently without waiting for perfect, polished thoughts. Let's see how it evolves.
