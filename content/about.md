There are some [great](https://simonwillison.net) [blogs](https://ronjeffries.com) out there where people just share what they're working on, thinking about, and what they've discovered. I have written many half-finished drafts and notes on many topics over the years, but I never got around to publishing. After about two decades of mucking around with software as both a happy hobbyist and *hardcore professional*, I want to change that and do more thinking and sharing in the open.
