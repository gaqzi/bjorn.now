title: Drone CI's when targets the merge target for PR events

Drone CI's `when` for deciding in which cases to run steps/pipelines [targets](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/docker/syntax/conditions/#by-branch) the __merge target__ branch for PRs and not the actual PR's, also it pulls from `refs/pull/<num>/head` instead of `refs/heads/<branch>` so you can't target the branch itself using the `pull_request` event (use `push` on the pipeline and then `branch` for the step instead).
