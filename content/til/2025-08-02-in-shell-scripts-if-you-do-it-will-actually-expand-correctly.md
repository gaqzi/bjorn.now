In shell scripts if you do `"$@"` it will actually expand "quoted sentences" correctly, and if you just do `$@` it will **always** unwrap them into single words, I thought that if you did `"$@"` it would combine all arguments into a single argument, and what it does is do what I thought `$@` alone did.
  
I.e., with `"$@"` the arguments `"one two" three` will be 2 arguments, the first being `"one two"`, and without it will become three arguments, all separated by space.
