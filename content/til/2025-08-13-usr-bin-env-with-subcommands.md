`/usr/bin/env` executes commands with flags/subcommands, not just bare executables. Which is great if you, for example, have a `script/lint` that's a Python script, and it needs dependencies from a virtualenv that isn't active when you call it.

Just put your shebang as `/usr/bin/env uv run python3` and it always runs in the virtualenv, no wrapper script needed. This feels obvious in hindsight, it's _what you expect_ from these tools ðŸ˜ƒ
