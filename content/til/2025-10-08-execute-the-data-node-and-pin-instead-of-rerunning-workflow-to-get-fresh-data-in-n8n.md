Execute the data node/step and pin it,
instead of rerunning the workflow or the step that relies on that data,
when modifying a step that needs fresh data.

Example: When modifying Mastodon/Bluesky cross-posting nodes that depend on an RSS Feed Trigger,
execute and pin the RSS node.
Then iterate on the posting logic that _only depends_ on the RSS data without triggering any posting.

Where my confusion came from: I haven't figured out fan-out and fan-in,
because I would expect to run my cross-posting in parallel and not sequentially,
butâ€¦ I have seen there _is_ some kind of fan-out, but how to use it? ðŸ¤·

So my assumption that I wouldn't get the data reloaded if I **only** ran the first step was incorrect,
and I've been a bit hesitant to test since there's only production (this personal stuff doesn't have a proper testing env ðŸ˜…).
