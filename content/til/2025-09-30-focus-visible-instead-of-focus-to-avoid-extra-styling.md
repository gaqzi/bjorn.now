Use `:focus-visible` instead of `:focus`, because it will [only show when helpful.][MDN]

`:focus-visible` only shows focus styling when the browser determines keyboard navigation is being used, unlike `:focus` which triggers on all interactions including mouse clicks.

<!--more-->

```css
button:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid blue; }
```

This prevents the "clicked button stays highlighted" problem while preserving accessibility for keyboard users. [Full browser logic on MDN][MDN].
