I just misplaced my Apple Watch in my apartment. Walking around looking for it,
and getting frustrated, I was thinking, "There ought to be a way to make it make
some sound, then I can play [Marco Polo] with the watch". But my Google-fu
failed me: no obvious way to "ping my watch". There's functionality for
[pinging the phone] from the watch though.

But there's a way to make some noise: testing out the alert volume in the
companion app on the phone.

## Steps

1. Verify that your Watch is paired:
   1. Settings
   2. Bluetooth
   3. My Devices should show your Watch:
      {{< img alt="Bluetooth settings on an iPhone" style="max-width: 375px;" src="/img/2015/11/bluetooth-settings.png" >}}
           
2. Open the Apple Watch app:
   1. Sounds & Haptics
   2. Drag the slider for alert volume to max
   3. Tap the knob on the slider.  
      The watch will make a sound every time you tap the knob.
      {{< img src="/img/2015/11/alert-volume-settings.png"
           alt="Alert volume settings" style="max-width: 375px;" >}}
3. Don't cry yourself to sleep over losing an expensive toy in the mess that is
   your own apartment.
