I'm running an open source project called [gocd-cli] which is, well, a command
line interface for [Go continuous delivery]. The intention is to make it
easier to handle common tasks around Go. But this post isn't really about that.

This project is supposed to be as portable as I can make it, becuse the original
need I felt for it was born on RHEL6. Which is *blessed* with Python 2.6 by
default. And we should definitely be looking to the future, meaning supporting
Python 3, and I luckily got a [pull request] for just that. Since I couldn't
find any free hosted Go around I went for the next best thing, [Snap CI],
which is also built by [ThoughtWorks].

Easy to get going and works well, it's not Go, but it's definitely the easy
starter drug for people that thinks [Jenkins] or [Travis] is good enough.

## The solution

Snap supports all the versions of Python that I want by default, but they
weren't all being made available at the same time. Python 2.6 and 2.7
were always there, but only one version of Python 3 at a time.

Luckily logging in to the [snap-shell] I found that all Python versions were
available in `/opt/local/python/<version>`.

A quick change to the Snap config, to add these to my `$PATH`, and [tox] ran
through without any problems.

What you'll need to add to your command box. **Note** it didn't work for me when
I added it to the environment variable field, I'm guessing it's because the `$PATH`
variable doesn't get interpolated correctly.

``` bash
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/local/python/3.3.5/bin:/opt/local/python/3.4.0/bin:/opt/local/python/3.5.0/bin"
```

And look, my tests are passing!
