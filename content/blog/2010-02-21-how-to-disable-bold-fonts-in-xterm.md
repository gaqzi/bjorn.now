I've so far in all my travels never found a terminal I like better than [xterm], maybe [urxvt], but I've had a problem disabling bold fonts for a very long time. **Update:** Seems this is a [known bug for xterm][xterm-bug].

There are a lot of X resource configuration options that makes you think you can disable bold fonts, but alas, I've had no luck with any of them. But if you set **the same font** for both normal and bold fonts it'll work! This little gem of knowledge I found as an off-hand remark on a [configuration page][xterm-conf] by [Emil Mikulic][emil], thank you!

I like the normal `fixed` font, I've tried many terminal fonts but I've always gotten back to it. So I simply tucked:

    
    
    xterm*font: fixed
    xterm*boldFont: fixed
    



Into my `~/.Xresources` and afterwards ran `xrdb -load ~/.Xresources` and started up a new xterm loaded with awesomeness!
