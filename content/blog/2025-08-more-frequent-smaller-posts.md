I'm trying something new here.
Instead of waiting for fully-formed thoughts,
I'm going to share more as I go: quick things I've learned, half-baked ideas, useful links.
I've added [some structure]({{< relref "about.md#how-im-organizing-things-here" >}}) to keep things findable, but the main goal is just to share more often.

The main feed will give you everything I post,
if you only want certain types of posts, I've also made section-specific feeds.
The blog feed is what you've been getting if you were already subscribed.
